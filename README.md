# PostStack

PostStack is a simple React Native + Expo application that interacts with mock data from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com). It demonstrates how to build a basic post management system where users can:

- View a list of posts
- Read detailed information about each post, including comments
- Create a new post by selecting a user and submitting a title and body

## Features

- 📰 List of posts
- 👀 Post details with full body text and image
- 💬 Comments under each post
- ✍️ Create a new post via a simple form
- 🔄 Data is fetched from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)
